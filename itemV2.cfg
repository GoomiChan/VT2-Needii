description = "[WIP] Shows class icons on pick ups in the order of those who need them the most.

Eg, if Bardin is the lowest on health then you, then the icon when you look at a hp pot would be Bardin, You, Sienna, Kruber.

Currently shows for 
* Bombs
* Hp Pots and Medpacks,
* Ammo drops
* Potions
* Tomes
* Grimes

TODO:
* More advance needs, eg take into account traits and trinkets, eg a waywatcher with ammo regen is less in need of ammo that saltz
* Weight hp pots more toward grim carriers
* Greed discouragement, eg if that Saltz keeps taking all the hp pots favor him less
* More adjustable options for the above.
* Show when you are trying to give the item to some one.

If you have any sugestions that I may have missed above please feel free to share with me :>
